    <h2>Paragraph</h2>
    <p>
        This paragraph
        contains a lot of lines
        in the source code,
        but the browser
        ignores it.
    </p>

    <p>
        The number of lines in a paragraph depends on the size of the browser window. If you resize the browser window,
        the number of lines in this paragraph will change.
    </p>

    <p>We can also use br tag. Like now<br> and it will continue on another line :o </p>
